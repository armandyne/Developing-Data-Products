<h3>About</h3>
<hr>
This app based on the Washington Post's dataset. 

In 2015, The Post created a database cataloging every fatal shooting nationwide by a police officer in the line of duty, collecting data on those who were killed and details of the shootings. The effort began because data compiled by the federal government was unreliable and incomplete.

This database is based on news reports, public records, social media and other sources. 

Original dataset located [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).
